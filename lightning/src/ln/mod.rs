//! You probably want to create a channelmanager::ChannelManager, and a routing::NetGraphMsgHandler first.
//! Then, you probably want to pass them both on to a peer_handler::PeerManager and use that to
//! create/manage connections and call get_and_clear_pending_events after each action, handling
//! them appropriately.
//!
//! When you want to open/close a channel or send a payment, call into your ChannelManager and when
//! you want to learn things about the network topology (eg get a route for sending a payment),
//! call into your NetGraphMsgHandler.
